## Explore connections within music through interactive graphs

Life’s top 3 might be winter coffee, the snooze button and the feeling when you find a new artist whom you like. My attempt to chasing that feeling is a music explorer ; let’s dive into it !

Through a WebApp and an API wrapped around Deezer. Search for an artist, album or track and view a graph of similar content.

- Expand the graph by double-clicking.
- Play track previews by hovering.
- Prune by alt-clicking.
